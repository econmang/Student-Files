				<h2>Hello World</h2>
				<p>Hello! I'm Evan and I enjoy quite a few things about my major. As a computer science major, I enjoy experimenting with different tech and programs to see what kind of things I can create. As of right now, me and my friend have finished our first web server written in C that was used to communicate with a small bot we had created with an Arduino microprocessor. As of now, I am currently working on my capstones for my two majors. For my mathematics capstone, I am engaging with and designing an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for processing text infromation. As for my Computer Science capstone, me and Jacob Cromwell have been contracted by Mozilla to help design a secure CLI program for interfacing with Amazon Web Services. It will be written in RUST and will hopefully be implemented by over 184 teams/accounts at Mozilla. Working in this capacity is something that I'm extremely excited about and I hope to continue work in the area of robotics and AI in my career.</p>
