Lab 3 Synthesis Questions

1.	Is deadlock possible in your ReaderWriter application? If so, describe a test case that causes a deadlock?  If not, describe the steps you took to avoid deadlock.

		I believe deadlock is possible as some of the threads may be waiting at the same time as another, each holding resources the other may need, resulting
		in circular wait.

2.	Describe the mechanism you used to ensure all application threads terminate?

		We attempted to create an overriding terminate() method in the ReaderWriter class that would interrupt each thread currently running and then attempt to call
		the schedule command on them, noting the interrupted flag. From there it has the ability to be handled locally by the catch clause for terminate method.
		We implemented by utlizing the exception of a maxtime thread handled in the batchthread class. By finding out if the instance of the process was a ReaderWriter,
		we could call its instance of the terminate method. Though they will stop processing, We are having trouble outputting some of these error messages 
		handled by these exceptions though.
