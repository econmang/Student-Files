        1.1 What is the Internet
                
            1.1.1 Nuts and Bolts Description
            
                - Hosts (End Systems): Devices connected to the internet
                (whether they be computers, mobile phones, security systems, etc.)
                    * End Systems are connected together by *communication links* and *packet switches*
                - Different links and mediums can transmit at different rates called *transmission rates*
                    * Transmission rate measured in bits/second
                - Packets: Sent data is split into these segments with header bytes on each package
                - Packet Switch: Takes a packet arriving from one of its communication links and forwards
                it to the next of its communication links.
                    * Most common packet switches are *routers* and *link-layer switches*
                    * link-layers are generally used in access networks while routers are used at network cores
                - The sequence of communication links and packet switches a packet takes from a sending end system
                to a recieiving end system is known as the route or path.
                - Protocols: Rules that controls sending and recieving information between communication links
                    * Common Protocols:
                        @ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol)
                        @ Often cited together as TCP/IP
                        @ HTTP for web
                        @ SMTP for e-mail
                    * Internet Standards are made by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to set rules
                    for the general use of the internet
                        @ RFC's (Request for Comments) are used to initially request for comments to find solutions to
                        problems with TCP/IP network design and protcols. This documentation makes up the Internet Standards

            1.1.2 A Services Description
            
                - The internet can be viewed as an infrastructure that provides services to applications
                - Applications that require connection through the internet to other end systems are called
                distributed applications
                - End systems attached to the internet provide an Application Programming Interface (API)
                    * API: Rules that specify how a programming on one end system asks the Internet 
                    infrastructure to deliver data to specific destination end systems and how the
                    program will run when it gets there.

            1.1.3 What Is a Protocol?
            
                - Specific messages are sent in order to gain the completion of different actions in response
                    * in order for this transmission to work, both have to operating with the same
                    protocols in mind or this interaction is pointless
                - Protocol: Defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more
                communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt
                of a message or other event.
                
        1.2 The Network Edge
           
                - Hosts and End Systems may be further sub-divided into two categories:
                    * clients: user systems that generally request and consume
                    media/resources on the internet
                    * servers: Nowadays they generally reside in large *data centers*
                    and they house information and resources the clients can request
                    on the internet.
            
                
            1.2.1 Access Networks
                
                - The two most common broadband types in homes are digital subscriber line (DSL)
                and cable.
                - DSL: a telco provides local phone access. So, the telco is also the ISP.
                A DSL modem uses the telephone (twisted-pair copper wire) to exchange data
                with the digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in the
                telco's CO (central office). Slower propogation rate because of the medium
                and shared resource.
                    * Different rates for internet access will be had due to tiering of
                    rates for different prices.
                    * Additionally, distance between the CO will limit the rate.
                        @ Anyone beyond 5-10 miles should consider another method
                        of accessing the internet.
                - Cable: uses existing television cable networks to transer
                internet data.
                    * Fiber optics are used to get to neighborhood-level junctions
                    where coaxial cables take over
                    * Can support much more people than DSL
                    * Because of fiber and coaxial use, it is sometimes referred to
                    as Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC).
                    * Cable internet access requires special modems called cable modems
                    * Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS): simlar to DSL's DSLAM
                - FTTH (Fiber to the Home): New method of fiber networks being developed
                promising faster propogation rates.
                - Ethernet has an average transmission rate of 100Mbps
                
            1.2.2 Physical Media
            
                - For each transmitter-reciever pair, there is a physical medium that propogates the signal (bit/electromagnetic wave)
                    * guided media: signals propogate through a physical medium (cable)
                    * unguided media: propogates freely (raido signals)
                    
                - Guided Media:
                    * Unshielded Twin Pair (UTP) Copper Wire
                    * Coaxial Cables (shared medium between computers)
                    * Fiber optics (light signals as bits of information in packet. Speed of light)
                    
        1.3 The Network Core
        
            1.3.1 Packet Switching
            
                - Transmission Rate: L/R
                    * Length of bits over the rate of transmission of the meidum
                    
                - delay(end-to-end) = N * (L/R) where N is the number of links to travel through
                    * store-and-forward: Packets are only sent forward after the whole packet reaches the communication link
               
                - Output buffer: There is a queue of stored packets waiting to be stored and forwarded. With bottlenecking at these areas, this can also cause queueing delay
                    * Queueing delay can exceed the capacity of a buffer and cause packet loss.
                
            1.3.2 Circuit Switching
            
                -
